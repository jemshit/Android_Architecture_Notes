# MVP (Model-View-Presenter)

> Potel paper link: http://www.wildcrest.com/Potel/Portfolio/mvp.pdf

## Introduction

- "MVP is a *user interface architectural pattern* engineered to
facilitate automated unit testing and improve the *separation of
concerns in presentation logic*" [[1]](#7-references).

- It makes code **understandable,
decoupled, testable and maintainable** (easy to refactor).
"Android bundles the UI and UI logic into the Activity class, which
necessitates Instrumentation to test the Activity. Since Instrumentation
is introduced, it is much more difficult (or impossible) to properly
unit test your UI logic when the dependencies in the code cannot be
mocked" [[2]](#7-references).

- In MVP, application is divided into at least 3 layers
and makes them independently testable from each other.
"With MVP we are able to take most of logic out from the activities so
that we can test it without using instrumentation tests" [[3]](#7-references).

- "...One common attribute of MVP is that there has to be a **lot of two-way dispatching.** For example, when someone clicks the "Save" button, the event handler delegates to the Presenter's "OnSave" method. Once the save is completed, the Presenter will then call back the View through its interface so that the View can display that the save has completed." [[19]](#7-references)

Flow goes like: **User-\> View-\> Presenter-\> Model(-\> Presenter-\> View)**

- "When control goes from View to Presenter and then from Presenter to
Model it is just a direct flow, it is easy to write code like this. You
get an easy '*User -> View -> Presenter -> Model -> Data*' sequence.
But when control goes like this: '*User -> View -> Presenter -> View
-> Presenter -> Model -> Data*', it just violates KISS principle.
**Don't play ping-pong between your view and presenter**" [[6]](#7-references).


## 1. Model

- It is **Data of UI** [[2]](#7-references) [[7]](#7-references). "The model is the data that will be displayed in the view. Please note that the word 'Model' is misleading. *It should rather be business logic that retrieves or manipulates a Model*" [[5]](#7-references). "**It is an interface responsible for managing data**. Model's responsibilities include using APIs, caching data, managing databases and so on. **The model can also be an interface that communicates with other modules in charge of these
responsibilities...** *If you are using the Clean architecture, the Model
could be an Interactor*" [[8]](#7-references) [[6]](#7-references) [[3]](#7-references).

- **Model knows nothing about other layers**. "It is best to set up the
Model Layer in such a way that the Presenter does not know whether it is
getting the data from the disk, memory, or network" [[9]](#7-references).

- **Why have different Entity (model) for each layer?** We might get
UserEntity which has name, surname from API but when displaying to UI,
we may need to show full name and ranking etc. which does not come from
API. Entity in Presentation may need to have such additional fields.
Transformation is done asynchronously in Presenter [[5]](#7-references). Other use cases can be some annotations on fields, model must implement or extend ORM class/Android class (e.g. Parcelable), fields for (UI) state... which some other layers do not care about [[16]](#7-references).

## 2. Presenter

- "Presenter is a layer that provides View with data from Model.
Presenter also handles background tasks" [[6]](#7-references). It is **Logic of UI** [[2]](#7-references).

- "The Presenter is the 'middle-man' (played by the controller
in MVC) and has references to both, view and model" [[5]](#7-references). "**It retrieves data from the model and returns it *formatted* to the view**. *Decides the actions to take when input events are received*" [[10]](#7-references).

- **No Android code here** [[8]](#7-references), it will make platform independent and no instrumentation test is required. "As far as tests are concerned, most of the code that you absolutely need to test will be in the Presenter. What's great is that all this code doesn't need Android to run, as it just has a reference to the View interface, and not its Android-specific implementation. This means that you can just mock the View interface, and write pure JUnit tests that make sure the right methods are called on that mock to test the *integrity* of your business logic" [[10]](#7-references).

- "*Lifecycle events* methods on the Presenter are simple and don't have
to map the (overly complicated) Android lifecycle ones. You don't have
to implement any of them, but you can implement as many as you want if
the Presenter needs to take specific actions" [[10]](#7-references) [[8]](#7-references). "Presenters do not need lifecycle callbacks from Activity, Fragment. It just needs to know if View is attached or not" [[11]](#7-references).

- "**Android Services** are a fundamental part of android app development... Therefore it's obvious that the Presenter is responsible to communicate with the Service" [[12]](#7-references).

- "**Don't retain presenter...** I think that presenter is not
something we should persist, it is not a data class, to be clear... the
presenter survives to orientation changes, but when Android kills the
process and destroys the Activity, the latter will be recreated together
with a new presenter. For this reason, this solution solves only half of
the problem". You should cache in Model layer [[9]](#7-references) [[13]](#7-references). But this way you won't save ongoing network requests. **Presenter is only for UI logic, not data logic (cache).**

## 3. View

- **Display of UI** [[2]](#7-references). "View is a layer that *displays data* and *reacts to user actions*" [[6]](#7-references) [[5]](#7-references). "On Android, this could be an Activity, a Fragment, an android.view.View or a Dialog" [[6]](#7-references) [[7]](#7-references). "*The View doesn't know anything about the business logic or how to get the data* it has to show to the user... It will not contain any functional or business logic like access to database or web server for example" [[14]](#7-references). "View layer with MVP becomes so simple, so it does not even need to have callbacks when requesting for data" [[6]](#7-references). **View never calls Model directly**.

- *Responsibilities of View are as follows:* informing presenter of relevant
lifecycle events (attach, detach), informing presenter of user input
events, laying out view and binding data to them, animations, navigating
to other screens [[10]](#7-references).

- "*The view should concern only about any necessary request parameters
to restore the state*" [[8]](#7-references). It shouldn't save presenter or data itself.

#### a) Passive View
- "The View is only doing what the Presenter tells the View to do. This
variant of Model-View-Presenter is called **Passive View**. The view
should be as dumb as possible. Let the Presenter control the view in an
abstract way. For instance: Presenter invokes 'view.showLoading()' but
Presenter should not control view specific things like animations. So
Presenter should not invoke methods like 'view.startAnimation()' etc. By
implementing MVP Passive View it's much easier to handle concurrency and
multithreading. (returning data from Async calls)" [[5]](#7-references).

- Make View Passive, "if you have a username/password form and a "submit" button, you don't write the validation logic inside the view but inside the
presenter. Your view should just collect the username and password and
send them to the presenter" [[8]](#7-references).

- "You can also move all the way to having the presenter do all the manipulation of the widgets. This style, which I call **Passive View** isn't part of the original descriptions of MVP but got developed as people explored *testability issues*. I'm going to talk about that style later, but that style is one of the flavors of MVP.‚Äù [[17]](#7-references)

#### b) Supervising Controller

- "The direction behind Bower and McGlashan was what I'm calling **Supervising Controller**, where the view handles a good deal of the view logic that can be described **declaratively** and the presenter then comes in to handle more **complex cases.**" [[17]](#7-references)

- "The MVP pattern can also be implemented such that the View knows of
the model. The view responds to state changes in the model **for simple UI updates**, while the presenter handles more complex UI logic. This more complex pattern is sometimes referred to as **Supervising Controller**. In Android, this can be accomplished by the Model using Java's Observable class and the View implementing the Observer interface; when something changes in the Model, it can call the Observable's notifyObservers method. It can also be implemented with Android's Handler class; when something changes in the Model, it can send a message to a handler that the View injects into it" [[2]](#7-references).

##### Why do I need to define interfaces for the View ?

- "*Since it's an interface you can change the view implementation*.
    You can simple move your code from something that extends Activity
    to something that extends Fragment." [[5]](#7-references)

- "Modularity: You can move the whole business logic, Presenter and
    View Interface in a standalone library project. Then you can use
    this library with the containing Presenter in various apps." [[5]](#7-references)

- "*You can easily write unit tests since you can mock views by
    implement the view interface*. One could also introduce a java
    interface for the Presenter to make unit testing by using mock
    Presenter objects even more easy." [[5]](#7-references)

- "Another very nice side effect of defining an interface for the
    view is that you don't get tempted to call methods of the activity /
    fragment directly from Presenter. You get a clear separation because
    while implementing the Presenter the only methods you see in your
    IDE's auto completion are those methods of the view interface. From
    our personal experiences we can say that this is very useful
    especially if you work in a team." [[5]](#7-references)

- "The methods to update the View (in View Interface) should be simple
    and targeted on a single element. This is better than having a single
    setMessage(Message m) method that will update everything, because
    **formatting what should be displayed should be the responsibility of the Presenter.** For example, you might want to start displaying 'You'
    instead of the user name if the current user is the author of the
    message, and this is part of your business logic" [[10]](#7-references).


##### MVP soundbites:

- "User gestures are handed off by the widgets to a Supervising Controller. (a presenter)" [[17]](#7-references)

- "The presenter coordinates changes in a domain model." [[17]](#7-references)

- "Different variants of MVP handle view updates differently. These vary from using. Observer Synchronization to having the presenter doing all the updates with a lot of ground in-between." [[17]](#7-references)


## 4. Solutions for Orientation Change problem:

- Using static Presenter to retain Presenter

- Using Singleton PresenterManager class and retaining Presenters. Presenters store loaded models and returns them after orientation change [[10]](#7-references) [[6]](#7-references)

- Using LoaderManager to retain Presenter. This way ongoing network requests do not get lost [[15]](#7-references)

- Retain Presenter until View totally gets destroyed

- Caching API response Observables in LRUCache [[9]](#7-references)

- Storing API request Observables in somewhere (not to make requests twice)

- Caching API response data in cache, database, file...

- Request parameters for Presenter are saved in View (Activity...) [[6]](#7-references)

- Save View's state (loading, showing error...) inside View (Activity...) itself

- Use Architecture Component's *ViewModel* as Presenter (attach, detach View when configuration change occurs) [[20]](#7-references)

## 6. Bonus

#### a) Configuration Change

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jemshit/android_architecture_notes/master/media_files/configuration_change.png" width="679" height="130" alt="Configuration Change"/></p>

Reference: [[6]](#7-references)

- "Case 1: A configuration change normally happens when a user flips
the screen, changes language settings, attaches an external monitor,
etc.

- Case 2: An Activity restart happens when a user has set 'Don't keep
activities' checkbox in Developer's settings and another activity
becomes topmost.

- Case 3: A process restart happens if there is not enough memory and
the application is in the background." [[6]](#7-references)

###### Simpler version

Reference: [[6]](#7-references)

"Now it looks much better. We only need to write two pieces of code to
completely restore an application in any possible case:

- save/restore for Activity, View, Fragment, DialogFragment

- restart background requests in case of a process restart" [[6]](#7-references)

#### b) Presenter save/restore options

Reference: [[15]](#7-references)

"Assumptions:

- Presenters should live in the memory only as long as the components
    they belong to

- The Presenter should be retained on configuration changes -- i.e. if we want to retain long running tasks (even if an activity is being recreated in the same moment)

- The Presenter should be destroyed if a related component like activity or fragment is destroyed, either because of memory running out problem or just because of user action -- we don't want to needlessly waste memory and store presenter in memory if related activity/fragment is currently not there

- The Presenter should be recreated after process recreation (if process of our app was killed because of low memory issues) -- we must ensure reliability and possibility to restore presenter state later even if process is destroyed" [[15]](#7-references)
